Memory Scraper
=============

The Memory Scraper is a tool allowing the user to search specific data pattern in a particular process, and get the user to know whether his program is vulnerable or not for memory scraping (AKA RAM scraping) attack.
Any data pattern can be chosen, including pre-defined regular expressions, e.g. credit cards, IP addresses etc.


<h2>Getting Started</h2>
1. Get the code and verify it's legitimate software :-)
2. Once you build the project, the start screen pops up. Click "Run".
3. The Processes List window aloows to choose the process to read from a dropdown list. Choose the required process from the dropdown list and press on "Select Process".
Note: If you see a process name that appears more than one time on the list and you're not sure which to select - don't worry, it doesn't matter (just right now) which one you will select because the next window will help you.
3.1. If a process appeares more than once in the list, it means that there are several running processes with the same name.
Therefore, "Multiple Processes Scan" window should appear.
This window lets you to decide which PID (process ID) you want the scan, among all the processes that have the process name you selected earlier. Choose a process and click "Select process".
4. In the new window you can start searching the data by choosing a regular expression and pressing on "Start".
5. Once you click "Start scan", the scan startz and when Memory Scraper finishes scanning all the data of the process - it starts over again until stopped explicitly.This way Memory Scarper is scanning and showing results in real time and update it results according to the changes being made in the selected process's data.
If more information about the selected process needed, click "Process Info".
This opens a window called "Process Information" which shows more details.
Click "Process Info" again in order to close that window.

Enjoy :-)
